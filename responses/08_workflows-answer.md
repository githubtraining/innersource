This pull request covers the basics, but here are some recommendations to help any contributor know the right way to open pull requests: 
- Use protected branches. Doing so will allow you to accept pull requests without fear of breaking production code.
- Use `CODEOWNERS` in combination with protected branches to ensure the right people review changes.
- If you haven't picked a workflow, use a common and well documented one.
- Be explicit about your deployment and release strategy.
