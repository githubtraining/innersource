### Almost done!

It's time to publish the InnerSource toolkit you've been working on.

To publish:

1. Go to the **Settings** tab for this repository
1. Scroll down to the section titled _GitHub Pages_
1. Select **master branch** in the Source drop down

That's all! GitHub Pages will then deploy your site and repository its status back to me.

<h3 align="center">I'll respond when I detect that GitHub Pages has finished deploying your site.</h3>
