### Answer :crystal_ball:

A repository _does_ exist at githubtraining/training-manual, but it is private.

## Understanding repository visibility

There are three types of repository visibility: **public, internal, and private**.

Our repository, `githubtraining/training-manual`, isn't public. It could be _internal_, which means only members of the organizations that an account owns will see it. Or, it could be _private_, which means only teams and individuals that have been granted access to it can see it.

This is an example of why ownership structure is important. Otherwise, it can be difficult for members of your team to find and contribute to projects. Having too many disconnected organizations with restrictive permissions isolates each organization's work.

Here are some recommendations based on some :sparkles: admirable :sparkles: use of GitHub that we've seen:

- Use the internal visibility (currently in beta) if you're working on behalf of an [enterprise account](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-enterprise-accounts).
- Name your repositories meaningfully. Usually a simple project or application name is best.
